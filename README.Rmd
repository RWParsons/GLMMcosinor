The goal of `{GLMMcosinor}` is to fit a cosinor model to rhythmic data but allow the functionality of a generalised linear (mixed-) model (GLM) framework using `{glmmTMB}`. For example, this includes the ability to use link functions appropriate for outcome variables that are Gaussian, Poisson, Gamma, or Binomial. 

Existing statistical software for circadian data analyses (including `cosinor` or `circacompare`) allow the user to fit such data using a regression model, but many are limited due to the lack being able to specify a link function, multiple components, or a hierarchical structure. `GLMMcosinor` aims to be comprehensive and flexible and is an improvement on other implementations of the cosinor model in R or Python. See table below for features available within currently available methods.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GLMMcosinor from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("RWParsons/GLMMcosinor")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GLMMcosinor)
```


```{r}
data(vitamind)
model <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12), data = vitamind)
summary(model)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
autoplot(model, superimpose.data = TRUE)
polar_plot(model)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- autoplot(model, superimpose.data = TRUE) +
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "none")
p2 <- polar_plot(model)
cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 1, rel_widths = c(0.4, 0.6))
```
