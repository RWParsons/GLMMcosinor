# GLMMcosinor

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


The goal of GLMMcosinor is to fit a generalised linear model (GLM) to circadian data that
may be sourced from any distribution listed in glmmTMB, such as gaussian, poisson, 
gamma, binomial. Existing programs allow the user to fit such data to a GLM, but 
many are limited in their design; GLMMcosinor aims to be comprehensive and flexible. 
Hence, GLMMcosinor is an improvement of other implementations of similar algorithms 
in R. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of GLMMcosinor from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RWParsons/GLMMcosinor")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GLMMcosinor)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
