# GLMMcosinor 0.0.9000

* First development version of `{GLMMcosinor}` for submission to rOpenSci.

* Includes functions for fitting a cosinor model, similarly to the {cosinor}
R package but using the `{glmmTMB}` modelling framework to allow more 
flexibility in terms of fitting **generalised** linear **mixed** cosinor models.
